## Kotlin Learning Journey - Day 3: Mastering Control Flow

Today was all about making decisions in code! I dove deep into Kotlin's control flow statements:

*   **`if`, `else if`, `else` expressions:** Learned how to execute different blocks of code based on conditions and how to use `if` as an expression to return values.
*   **`when` expressions:** Explored Kotlin's powerful and versatile alternative to the traditional `switch` statement. Practiced matching values, ranges (`in`), and using `else` for comprehensive logic.
*   **Practical Application:** Built a "Simple User Profile Categorizer" to apply these concepts, handling different user attributes to determine categories and discounts.
*   **Kotlin Tip:** Discovered how to use `when` without an argument for cleaner and more flexible conditional chains.

Feeling more confident in directing the flow of my Kotlin programs! Next up: Loops!

**Key Learnings:**
*   Conditional logic is fundamental.
*   `if` and `when` can be used as expressions, making code more concise.
*   Kotlin's `when` is incredibly powerful for complex decision-making.
