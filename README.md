Android-Development-Master-Journey
Welcome to my public journey to master Android development using Kotlin!
This repository is my daily log, code archive, and learning journal as I build my skills and share everything I learn—step by step, day by day.

🚀 About This Project
Goal: Become a proficient Android developer by consistently learning, building, and reflecting in public.

Approach: Each day, I tackle a new topic or challenge, document my process, and share code and insights.

Audience: Beginners, self-learners, and anyone interested in Android or Kotlin—join me, learn with me, or use this repo as a resource!
