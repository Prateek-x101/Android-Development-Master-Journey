Android-Development-Master-Journey
Welcome to my public journey to master Android development using Kotlin!
This repository is my daily log, code archive, and learning journal as I build my skills and share everything I learn—step by step, day by day.

—> About This Project
Goal: Become a proficient Android developer by consistently learning, building, and reflecting in public.

Approach: Each day, I tackle a new topic or challenge, document my process, and share code and insights.

Audience: Beginners, self-learners, and anyone interested in Android or Kotlin—join me, learn with me, or use this repo as a resource!

🗂️ Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
» README.md – Project overview (this file)

» Day 1/ – Folder for Day 1 notes and code

  > README.md – Day 1 notes and progress

  > Main.kt – Day 1 code

» Day 2/ – Folder for Day 2 notes and code

  > README.md – Day 2 notes and progress

  > Main.kt – Day 2 code

... – More day-wise folders as the journey continues

.gitignore – Git ignore rules

Each day’s folder contains:

A README.md with that day’s goals, notes, and reflections
Code files and examples for the day’s topic
