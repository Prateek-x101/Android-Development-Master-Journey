##  Reflections

Today marks the exciting start of my Android development journey!. Doing code outside of any IDE make me feel excited and give good vibes but to run it in android studio was hectic but when i find the way to achive it which seems very simple right now that time time feels stuck well, I’m motivated to keep learning and building every day.
